# VeeDrive

This is the fullstack app for the [Apollo tutorial](http://w3resource.com). ðŸš€

## File structure

The app is split out into two folders:
- `start`: Starting point for the tutorial
- `final`: Final version

From within the `start` and `final` directories, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd final/server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd final/client && npm i && npm start
```

## Credits

The app is a rewrite of Apollo Tutorial App, Many thanks to them
